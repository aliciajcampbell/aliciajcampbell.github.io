# Website source.

This is the source page of my website, https://aliciajcampbell.github.io

This website is hosted using
[Github pages](https://pages.github.com/), and is created using
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which allows for writing content in markdown,
which then gets converted into HTML for hosting.
