# Research Overview

As we age, our brains undergo significant changes. While structural and biochemical alterations are well-documented, the functional differences in neuronal networks remain less understood. These differences, revealed through electrophysiological markers, offer a fascinating glimpse into the intricate cognitive landscape of the ageing brain. Ageing is a complex, multifaceted process associated with various cognitive changes, including declines in memory, attention, processing speed, and executive functions. Yet, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying cognition in healthy ageing and their contribution to cognitive resilience or decline are still not fully elucidated. My research aims to bridge this gap by investigating how patterns of neural activity contribute to age-related cognitive decline. Furthermore, I explore whether lifestyle interventions can modulate these patterns to maintain or even improve cognitive function in older age.

More specifically, my work focuses on measuring, analysing, and interpreting two key aspects of brain activity: periodic activity (neural oscillations) and aperiodic activity (often described as '1/f activity'). These signals are captured through electrical recordings of the brain. By analysing these signals, we can infer properties of physiological activity and gain insights into their relationship with cognition and ageing processes in older adults. This approach allows us to delve deeper into the neural mechanisms that support cognitive function throughout the lifespan and identify if lifestyle interventions can target these mechanisms to promote healthy cognitive ageing. As our global population continues to age, this research becomes increasingly relevant.

My current work contributing to my PhD thesis involves collecting and analysing brain activity and cognitive experiment data from human older adult subjects. I examine these measurements at a baseline level and then again following a multimodal lifestyle intervention.
