## Overview

TBA
<!-- My work includes a lot of code development, mostly in the
[Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language,
including developing
[open-source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)
software tools, releasing code for my research projects (see the [research page](research.html)),
and well as developing code-related teaching materials (see the [teaching page](teaching.html)).

My code is on Github, including on my
[personal page](https://github.com/TomDonoghue), the
[VoytekLab page](https://github.com/voytekresearch), and is indexed
[here](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/TomDonoghue/blob/main/codemap.md). -->

## Pipelines

TBA
<!-- Pipelines for processing particular datatypes. -->

<!-- ### Human Single-Unit Pipeline

`HSUPipeline` is a pipeline for processing and analyzing single-unit neural data from human subjects.
It includes templates for pre-processing, organizing, and analyzing human single-unit data.

## Project Code

TBA
<!-- I also strive to make the code underlying individual projects openly available.

The following project have openly available analysis code:
- [Single neurons in the human medial temporal lobe flexibly shift representations across spatial and memory tasks](https://github.com/HSUpipeline/analyzeTH)
- [Frequency band ratio measures conflate periodic and aperiodic neural activity](https://github.com/voytekresearch/bandratios)
- [Parameterizing neural power spectra into periodic and aperiodic components](https://github.com/fooof-tools/Paper)
- [Methodological considerations for studying neural oscillations](https://github.com/OscillationMethods/OscillationMethods)
- [Automated meta-analysis of the event-related potential (ERP) literature](https://github.com/ERPscanr/ERPscanr) -->
