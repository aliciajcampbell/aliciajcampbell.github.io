# Welcome!

Hello, I'm Alicia! I'm a research scientist, working in the area of cognitive neuroscience in ageing.
I am currently a PhD research student in the [Healthy Brain Ageing (HBA)](https://www.usc.edu.au/thompson-institute/research-at-the-thompson-institute/healthy-brain-ageing-program) lab, led by [Dr Sophie Andrews](https://www.usc.edu.au/staff/dr-sophie-andrews#biography) at the University of the Sunshine Coast - [Thompson Institute](https://www.usc.edu.au/thompson-institute), Queensland, Australia. (I am currently completing this remotely from Sweden) I am also currently a guest doctoral researcher in the [Lund Memory Lab](https://www.psy.lu.se/en/research/neuro/lund-memory-lab), led by [Professor Mikael Johanson](https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/mikael-johansson) at Lund University, Lund, Sweden.

My research is focused on the analysis of novel EEG biomarkers related to age-related cognitive decline, with a focus on sustained attention, and how these markers change and are associated with cognition after a multimodal lifestyle intervention. For a more thorough overview, I have described my research on the [research](research.html) page.

This work contributes to the [Lifestyle Intervention Study for Dementia Risk Reduction (LEISURE)](https://www.usc.edu.au/thompson-institute/research-at-the-thompson-institute/healthy-brain-ageing-program/the-leisure-study) within the HBA lab which targets modifiable dementia risk factors in older adults through lifestyle interventions. For the full scientific version, you can check out my list of [publications](publications.html).

## Brief Profile

I grew up in Queensland, Australia, moving between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast regions, where the warmth of the sun, the salty sea breeze, and long walks on the beach were integral parts of my daily life. Initially enrolled in a Bachelor of Nursing Science, I switched after a year to a Bachelor of Biomedical Science, majoring in Clinical Measurements. This change stemmed from my longstanding fascination with the human brain. My major allowed me to intern at a large hospital as a neurophysiology scientist, primarily focusing on EEG (electroencephalography) testing. This experience ignited what has now become a passion for studying the brain's electrical activity. I then embarked on a PhD to delve deeper into electrophysiology. My research involves learning emerging EEG analysis methods and measures, with a focus on their potential implications for cognition and ageing.

Towards the end of my second year, I made the bold decision to move from Australia to Sweden. While I had always planned to move to Europe *after* completing my PhD, my Estonian partner had just accepted a PhD contract there, presenting an opportunity too significant to pass up. In Sweden, while completing the rest of my PhD remotely, I quickly became involved with the Lund Memory Lab at Lund University. Here, I've been able to expand my skills and contribute to even more research, with hopes of continuing this work post-PhD.

Throughout my journey, I've developed a deep appreciation for the philosophy of the scientific method. I'm passionate about promoting science that is transparent, accessible, equitable, and inclusive for all. 

One of the most rewarding aspects of working in science is collaborating with incredible individuals. I've been extremely fortunate to have amazing mentors who have guided me thus far, and their influence is reflected in everything I do. As I continue my scientific journey, I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead, both in neuroscience and in fostering a more inclusive scientific community.
